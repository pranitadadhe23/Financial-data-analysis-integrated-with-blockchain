# 📊 Financial Data Analysis Integrated with Blockchain 🔗

This project combines financial data analysis with the principles of blockchain technology to ensure secure and transparent handling of stock prediction data. It includes a user-friendly interface built with Gradio for real-time interaction.

## 🚀 Features

- 📈 **Financial Data Analysis** using `yfinance`
- 🔐 **Blockchain Integration** with `hashlib` for securing predictions
- 🖥️ **Interactive Dashboard** with `Gradio`
- 🧠 Machine Learning model used for stock trend predictions (customizable)

## 🧰 Tools and Libraries Used

- **Jupyter Notebook** – For development and experimentation
- **yfinance** – To fetch real-time and historical financial data
- **hashlib** – To simulate a blockchain structure for secure record-keeping
- **Gradio** – To build an interactive frontend interface

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Financial-data-analysis-integrated-with-blockchain.git
   cd Financial-data-analysis-integrated-with-blockchain
2. Install required packages:
pip install yfinance gradio pandas matplotlib

📋 How to Use
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook

Run the notebook cells step by step:
Fetch financial data
Analyze trends and make predictions
Generate hashes and store data blocks
Launch the Gradio interface to interact with your predictions

The Gradio interface allows users to:
Select a stock ticker
Get stock data insights
View secured blockchain-stored predictions

🔐 Blockchain Module Overview
Every prediction is stored in a simple blockchain block containing:
1.Index
2.Timestamp
3.Data (stock prediction)
4.Previous hash
5.Current hash

Ensures immutability and traceability of past predictions.
